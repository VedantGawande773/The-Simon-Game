# About Simon Game

The Simon Game is an electronic memory game that tests the player's ability to remember and repeat a series of patterns. This project is a digital version of the classic Simon Game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game has a simple interface, consisting of four colored buttons - red, green, blue, and yellow. The game starts by randomly lighting up one of the buttons, and the player must repeat the pattern by clicking on the buttons in the correct order. The game progressively becomes harder as the pattern becomes longer.

It keeps track of the player's score and displays it at the end of each round. The game also includes sound effects and animations to enhance the user experience.
